# ERC20SecurityLockExtension

An abstract contract, that can be added to any ERC20 token, to protect tokens from wallet hacks. The idea behind this extension is to bring the protection, the use of multi signature wallet brings, but also keep the felxibility single signature wallets have, to all ERC20 tokens.

## Thought behind it

Wallet hacks, due to the widespread use of browser extensions, have gotten rather common in the space and its just to be seen how more frequent these will occur in the future, keeping the massive financial values at stake, in mind. Additionally, using wallets safely, by keeping them as cold as possible, or using multi signature wallets, with cold wallets as signers, while also keeping the comfort of just transfering things quickly, is not compatible.

Tokens that have this extension implemented, and whose holders have decided to secure their tokens, are not prone to any kind of wallet hacks.
This is achieved by holders being able to specify a token specific lockaddress that can decide, just as the token holder can, to lock the holders tokens. If locked by one party, the other party wont be able to transfer the holders tokens (for the lockaddress only through the transferfrom function, according to ERC20 anyway).

Any scenario, in which an attacker is trying to either transfer tokens, or block transactions on either wallet, is solvable with this extension.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
